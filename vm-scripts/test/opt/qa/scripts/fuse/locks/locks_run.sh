# GOAL : This tests try to stress fcntl locking functions. A master process set a lock on a file region (byte range locking).
# * Some slaves process tries to perform operations on this region, like read, write, set a new lock ... Expected results of this
# * operations are known. If the operation result is the same as the expected one, the test sucess, else it fails.
